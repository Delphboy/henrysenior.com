        <div id="about">
            <p>
                I'm a final year computer science student at the University of Salford, and a software engineer at
                Carfinance 247.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my time at the University of Salford I have represented my workshop groups on the staff/student
                committee within the department in both first and second year. In the November of my first year I became
                the President of the Computing Society, a role I maintained until the Easter of my second year. During
                my second year, I lead the society's mentorship scheme - a weekly drop in class for first years who
                wanted extra support.
            </p>
            <p>
                At Carfinance 247 I am one of two full stack software engineers on the web team. Throughout my time
                there; I have helped maintain and improve legacy .NET MVC applications, upgraded old .NET Framework
                projects to .NET
                Core, and worked on the website's redesign. As a member of the web team I work in a multi-disciplinary
                team that includes; stakeholders, designers, marketing, front end engineers, and full stack engineers.

            </p>
            <p>
                During my placement year at Carfinance247 I used my monthly R&D days to develop a system that could
                detect placeholder images in the company’s car search system. I exposed this service as an API written
                in python that would take the URL of an image and determine whether it was a placeholder image by using
                the thresholding methods from OpenCV. I also spent one day a sprint with the data science team where I
                investigated developing a vehicle price prediction model.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of Computer Science, I am an avid violin player. During term time I play with Bolton Chamber
                Orchestra and Bolton Music Centre’s Greater Norther Folk Ensemble. Outside of these groups I also play
                for fun. My current pieces include; The allegro from Bach’s violin concerto in A minor, the andante from
                Tchaikovsky’s violin concerto in d major, and Gershwin’s It ain’t necessarily so.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also train regularly with NTK Martial Arts Jujitsu club, where I am a first dan black belt. As well as training, I also assist in teaching; having previously volunteered with the club at my primary school.
            </p>
            <p>
                November 2018 marked 100 years since Armistice day. To celebrate this, the Association of Bell Ringing aimed to recruit 1400 new bell ringers in honour of the 1400 bell ringers that lost their lives during the First World War. As part of this campaign I learned to ring at one of my local towers and have continued learning to ring.
