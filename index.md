Currently I'm a PhD student at QMUL supervised by [Dr Luca Rossi](https://blextar.github.io/luca-rossi/). My research focusses on how GNNs can be used to improve scene understanding tasks like image captioning and visual question answering.

When I'm away from the keyboard, I enjoy music and martial arts.
