title: About Me
---

I studied Computer Science at The University of Salford. It was here I developed an interest in computer vision. For my final year project I developed an image captioning system similar to [Facebook's Automatic Alt Text](https://tech.fb.com/using-artificial-intelligence-to-help-blind-people-see-facebook/) generator.

Upon completion of my undergraduate I moved to The University of Liverpool to study on their MSc in Advanced Computer Science course, where I further specialised in machine learning. For my masters thesis I developed a 3D object detection system that fused both 2D image inputs and LiDAR data. Building on recent developments in the field, it implemented a Graph Neural Network to process the LiDAR data and predict object bounding boxes.
