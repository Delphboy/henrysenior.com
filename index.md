Henry is a PhD student at Queen Mary, University of London in the Digital Environment Research Institute (DERI). His research focuses on the development and application of Graph Neural Networks to Vision-Language problems such as image captioning. He is also one of the organisers of [DERI Lunch and Learn](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/deri/networks/lunch--learn/), a bi-weekly informal seminar for PhD students to expand their knowledge of the research process and better equip them for their PhDs. Before joining DERI, Henry completed a BSc(hons) in Computer Science with Professional Experience at the University of Salford and an MSc in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Liverpool. He also has three years of experience (full time and part time) as a Full Stack Software Engineer.

He's supervised by [Dr Shanxin Yuan](https://shanxinyuan.github.io/), [Dr Luca Rossi](https://blextar.github.io/luca-rossi/), and [Prof Greg Slabaugh](http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~gslabaugh/).
