Henry is a PhD student in the Digital Environment Research Institute (DERI) at Queen Mary, University of London, where he explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and computer vision. His research focuses on developing Graph Neural Networks for Vision-Language problems, with a particular emphasis on developing multimodal representations that aid scene understanding. Before joining DERI, Henry completed a BSc(Hons) in Computer Science with Professional Experience at the University of Salford and an MSc in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Liverpool. He has also worked as a software engineer in the financial services sector.

In addition to his research, Henry has served on the programme committee of the [IAPR S+SSPR 2024](https://sites.google.com/view/s-sspr-2024/home
) and is serving again for [2026](https://ssspr2026.inf.unibe.ch/). He also regularly reviews for a number of journals and conferences.

He is supervised by [Dr Shanxin Yuan](https://shanxinyuan.github.io/), [Dr Luca Rossi](https://blextar.github.io/luca-rossi/), and [Prof Greg Slabaugh](http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~gslabaugh/).
