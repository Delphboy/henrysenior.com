After four wonderful years in QMUL's [Digital Environment Research Institute](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/deri/) supervised by [Dr Shanxin Yuan](https://shanxinyuan.github.io/), [Dr Luca Rossi](https://blextar.github.io/luca-rossi/), and [Prof Greg Slabaugh](http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~gslabaugh/), Henry joined The University of Salford as a Computer Science lecturer. As a member of the Salford Informatics Research Centre, his research explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and computer vision. Specifically, he works on applying Graph Neural Networks within Vision-Language problems, placing particular emphasis on developing multimodal representations that aid scene understanding. In addition to his research, Henry is also active member of teaching staff, helping to deliver a range of modules across Salford's undergrauate and DipHE courses. Further to his research and teaching committments, Henry has served on the programme committee of the [IAPR S+SSPR 2024](https://sites.google.com/view/s-sspr-2024/home) and is serving again for [2026](https://ssspr2026.inf.unibe.ch/). He also regularly reviews for a number of journals and conferences.
